In this repository there is a data file, and several sample scripts to analyze
the that dataset. The data is in the `data` directory, and consists of an
alignment of the 18s gene.

The tools which we have provided samples scripts are MrBayes, RAxML-NG, and
RevBayes.

# MrBayes

```
cd mrbayes
mb mb.nex
```

# RAxML-NG

```
cd raxml
./run.sh
```

# RevBayes

```
cd revbayes
rb run.Rev
```
